OIBSIP Projects - Python
This repository contains three Python projects developed during the Oasis Infobyte Summer Internship Program (OIBSIP). These projects aim to showcase my skills in Python programming, problem-solving, and application development. Below are the projects included:

Projects Overview
BMI Calculator
A graphical user interface (GUI) application for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) using Tkinter or PyQt. The app takes height and weight inputs from the user and calculates BMI. The application also allows users to store data and view historical records with trend analysis.

Basic Weather App
A basic weather app developed using Python that fetches live weather information from an API. The app allows users to enter a city name and receive the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more.

Random Password Generator
A simple Python application that generates random passwords based on user input for length and criteria (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols). This helps users create strong and secure passwords for their accounts.

Project Details
1. BMI Calculator
Libraries Used: Tkinter, Matplotlib (for graphs), Pandas (for data storage)

Features:

Takes height and weight as inputs.

Calculates BMI and classifies it based on standard BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

Displays results with a graphical trend of historical BMI data.

Data can be stored in a file for future reference.

2. Basic Weather App
Libraries Used: requests (for API calls), Tkinter (for GUI)

Features:

Fetches real-time weather data for a given city using an external weather API.

Displays weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and description.

Supports multiple cities.

3. Random Password Generator
Libraries Used: random, string

Features:

Generates random passwords with user-specified criteria (length, inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols).

Easy-to-use interface for secure password creation.

How to Run the Projects

Copy
Edit
python main.py
Conclusion
These projects helped me further my understanding of Python programming, GUI development, and working with APIs. I am constantly looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges.
